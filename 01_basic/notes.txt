1. Variables
    Container for storing data. There are rules for defining variables:
    - A variable can consist of upper and lowercase letters, the digits 0-9 and the underscore character(_).
    - The first character of a variable cannot be a digit.
    - Keywords like print, if, etc are reserved and cannot be used as variable names.
    - Variables are case-sensitive; therefore x is different from X.b

2. DataTypes
    1, 1.1, "Subha"ï¼ŒTrue, False
    integer, float, strings, boolean
    
3. Python Operators
    +, -, *, /, %

4. If-else Statements
    In Python, if, elif (else if) and else statements are used for conditional execution, allowing different blocks of code to run based on whether specific conditions are met.
