1. Variables
    Container for storing data. There are rules for defining variables:
    - A variable can consist of upper and lowercase letters, the digits 0-9 and the underscore character(_).
    - The first character of a variable cannot be a digit.
    - Keywords like print, if, etc are reserved and cannot be used as variable names.
    - Variables are case-sensitive; therefore x is different from X.b
